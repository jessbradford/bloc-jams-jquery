# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app. This was my first time using jQuery, and some of the troubles that I ran into was getting everything to be in sync with the songs. For example, when you pressed play, the song time updating as the song played, the buttons changing to pause/play when pressed, etc.


### Built with
Bloc Jams is a music playing app created with jQuery. This allows users to play and pause music, navigate through a song list, and adjust volume.
